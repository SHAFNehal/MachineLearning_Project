This is part of our course at UTSA Fall 2016 course (Machine Learning/BigData EE-6973-001-Fall-2016). This repository will be used to collaborate with the team mates to both write and develop the code for the project. We will be using open source software library [TensorFlowâ„¢ ](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

***
